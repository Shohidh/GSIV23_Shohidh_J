Solution for React challenge
To Run the code, go into find_movies folder and run "npm install" and "npm start" the code will get compiled and will be run on default port "http://localhost:3000/"

The infite loading part was bit challenging and used "react-infinite-scroller" library to call the API and load extra data on scroller.
Used material-ui reusable components which is more scalable and User friendly

If I am provided with extra time, I would have added UI elements for Rating and most of the elements in Iconogrophic way. Would have improvised the User experience with responsiveness.

It was fun and interesting to develop this application :)
